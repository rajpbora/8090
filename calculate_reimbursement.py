ALGORITHM V9: REFINED PATTERN DETECTION
Fixing V8's overly broad pattern detection for 5-day trips

KEY INSIGHTS FROM V8:
- Score improved to 19,709 but new high-error cases emerged
- 5-day trips with very high receipts (>$2000) expect HIGH outputs, not penalties
- Need much more precise pattern detection
- Only penalize specific cases that actually expect low outputs
